# Real-Time 3D Deck Design Blueprint

This document summarizes a blueprint for building an interactive web-based deck designer. It combines techniques from Babylon.js, Three.js, and RedX Decks to render a live-updating 3D deck model, export blueprints, and integrate with a chatbot interface.

---

## Engine & Scene Setup
- Use either **Three.js** or **Babylon.js** as the WebGL engine.
- Create a `PerspectiveCamera` with `OrbitControls` for free navigation.
- Create a top-down `OrthographicCamera` for blueprint views.
- Enable antialiasing and tone mapping for crisp visuals.

## Interactive Editing & Modular Components
- Represent deck pieces with Three.js primitives like `BoxGeometry` and `CylinderGeometry`.
- Allow real-time updates as the user changes dimensions.
- Attach `TransformControls` for drag/scale interactions.
- Modularize stairs, rails, posts, and deck boards so they can be toggled on/off.

## Material Mapping & Texturing
- Apply tiling textures using `THREE.TextureLoader` and `RepeatWrapping`.
- Offer material choices (e.g. composite, PVC) with PBR materials.

## Blueprint & Export Generation
- Use the orthographic camera to render plan and elevation views.
- Export PNG snapshots via `renderer.domElement.toDataURL()`.
- Provide GLTF/GLB export using `GLTFExporter`.
- Serialize project state with `scene.toJSON()` or custom JSON for saving/loading.

## Performance Optimizations
- Use `THREE.InstancedMesh` for repeated geometry like posts and boards.
- Merge static geometry where possible with `BufferGeometryUtils.mergeBufferGeometries`.
- Reduce texture swaps with atlases and keep draw calls low.

## Chatbot Integration
- Communicate between frontend and backend via WebSockets.
- The chatbot parses commands ("add stairs", "resize deck") and sends parameters to the 3D app.
- Display results back in the chat and update the deck scene in real time.

This outline is intended as a high-level reference for developers working on the DeckChatbot project. For more details see the repository README.
