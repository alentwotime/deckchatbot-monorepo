# Docker Build Issue - Complete Solution

## 🔍 Issue Identified

Your Docker build is failing with this error:
```
> [frontend builder 8/8] RUN npm run build && rm -rf node_modules && npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force:
1.579 > deckchatbot-frontend@1.0.0 build
1.579 > webpack --mode production
1.579
1.592 sh: webpack: not found
```

## ✅ Root Cause Analysis

**Good News**: Your configuration is correct!
- ✅ Frontend Dockerfile properly installs all dependencies (including webpack)
- ✅ Package.json correctly includes webpack as a dev dependency
- ✅ Build script properly uses webpack

**The Problem**: Docker build cache contains old cached layers from before the fix was applied.

## 🚀 Solution Steps

### Step 1: Restart Docker Desktop

Docker appears to be in an unstable state. First, restart it:

1. **Close Docker Desktop completely**
   - Right-click the Docker whale icon in system tray
   - Select "Quit Docker Desktop"
   - Wait for it to fully close

2. **Restart Docker Desktop**
   - Launch Docker Desktop from Start Menu
   - Wait for the whale icon to appear and stop spinning
   - Verify with: `docker info`

### Step 2: Manual Fix (Recommended)

Once Docker is stable, run these commands:

```powershell
# Navigate to docker directory
cd docker

# Stop any running containers
docker compose down

# Remove old containers
docker compose rm -f

# Clear build cache (this is the key step!)
docker builder prune -f

# Remove old images
docker image prune -f

# Rebuild without cache
docker compose build --no-cache

# Start services
docker compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Alternative - Use Fix Script

If Docker is stable, you can use the automated script:

```powershell
# From project root
.\fix-docker-build-issue.ps1
```

## 🎯 Why This Happens

Docker caches build layers for efficiency. Even though your Dockerfile is now correct, Docker may use cached layers from the old version where webpack wasn't available during the build step.

The `--no-cache` flag forces Docker to rebuild every layer from scratch, ensuring webpack is properly installed.

## ✅ Expected Results

After the fix:
- ✅ Frontend accessible at: http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Backend API accessible at: http://localhost:8000
- ✅ AI Service accessible at: http://localhost:8001

## 🔧 Verification

Check if services are running:
```powershell
docker compose ps
```

View logs if needed:
```powershell
docker compose logs -f
```

## 📝 Important Notes

- The OPENAI_API_KEY warning is expected when using Ollama (AI_PROVIDER=ollama)
- The rebuild process may take 5-15 minutes
- Ensure stable internet connection for downloading dependencies

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

1. **Restart your computer** (clears any Docker state issues)
2. **Check disk space**: `docker system df`
3. **Complete cleanup**: `docker system prune -a --volumes`
4. **Rebuild from scratch**: Follow Step 2 above

Your configuration is correct - this is purely a Docker cache issue that will be resolved once the cache is cleared!
