# Automatic Git Push Feature

## Overview

This repository is configured with an automatic git push feature. Every time you make a commit, the changes are automatically pushed to the remote repository. This ensures that all changes are always pushed through git, keeping the remote repository up-to-date with your local changes.

## How It Works

The automatic git push feature is implemented using a git post-commit hook. This hook is a script that runs automatically after a commit is made. The script gets the current branch name and pushes the changes to the remote repository.

The post-commit hook is located in the `.git/hooks` directory and is named `post-commit`. Here's what the script does:

1. Gets the current branch name using `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
2. Pushes the changes to the remote repository using `git push origin <branch-name>`

## Benefits

- Ensures that all changes are always pushed to the remote repository
- Prevents forgetting to push changes after committing
- Keeps the remote repository up-to-date with your local changes
- Simplifies the git workflow by automating the push step

## Disabling the Feature

If you need to disable the automatic git push feature, you can do so by renaming or removing the post-commit hook:

```bash
# Rename the post-commit hook to disable it
mv .git/hooks/post-commit .git/hooks/post-commit.disabled

# To re-enable it, rename it back
mv .git/hooks/post-commit.disabled .git/hooks/post-commit
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the automatic git push feature, check the following:

1. Make sure the post-commit hook is executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x .git/hooks/post-commit
   ```

2. Check if the post-commit hook is properly configured:
   ```bash
   cat .git/hooks/post-commit
   ```

3. If you're working on Windows, make sure the post-commit hook has the correct line endings (LF, not CRLF).

4. If you're behind a proxy or have network issues, the automatic push might fail. In this case, you'll need to push manually:
   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

## Adding the Feature to Other Repositories

To add this feature to other repositories, copy the post-commit hook to the `.git/hooks` directory of the repository and make it executable:

```bash
cp post-commit-hook.sh /path/to/repo/.git/hooks/post-commit
chmod +x /path/to/repo/.git/hooks/post-commit
```

Or create the post-commit hook manually with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Post-commit hook to automatically push changes to the remote repository
# This ensures that changes are always pushed through git

# Get the current branch name
BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# Push changes to the remote repository
echo "Automatically pushing changes to remote repository..."
git push origin $BRANCH

# Exit with the status of the push command
exit $?
```
