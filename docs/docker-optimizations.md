# Docker Configuration Optimizations

This document summarizes the optimizations made to the Docker configurations in the DeckChatbot monorepo to reduce image sizes, implement multi-stage builds, and improve container security.

## Overview

The following Docker configurations have been optimized:
- `apps/frontend/Dockerfile`
- `apps/backend/Dockerfile`
- `apps/ai-service/Dockerfile`
- `docker/docker-compose.yml`
- `.dockerignore`

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Multi-Stage Builds

#### Frontend (Already had multi-stage, improved)
- **Builder stage**: Uses `node:22-alpine` for building the application
- **Production stage**: Uses `nginx:stable-alpine` for serving static files
- **Improvements**: Added non-root user creation and better layer caching

#### Backend (New multi-stage implementation)
- **Builder stage**: Uses `python:3.11-slim` with build dependencies (build-essential, git)
- **Production stage**: Uses `python:3.11-slim` with only runtime dependencies (curl)
- **Benefits**: Separates build tools from production image, reducing final image size

#### AI Service (New multi-stage implementation)
- **Builder stage**: Uses `python:3.11-slim` with build dependencies (build-essential, libtesseract-dev)
- **Production stage**: Uses `python:3.11-slim` with runtime dependencies (curl, tesseract-ocr)
- **Benefits**: Keeps OCR functionality while removing build tools from final image

### 2. Security Improvements

#### Container Security
- **Non-root users**: All containers now run as non-root users (uid 1001)
- **User creation**: Proper user and group creation in all Dockerfiles
- **File ownership**: Correct ownership assignment using `--chown` flags

#### Docker Compose Security
- **no-new-privileges**: Prevents privilege escalation
- **Capability dropping**: Removes all capabilities and only adds necessary ones (NET_BIND_SERVICE)
- **Read-only filesystem**: Frontend container runs with read-only root filesystem
- **Temporary filesystems**: Proper tmpfs mounts for writable directories

### 3. Image Size Reduction

#### Dependency Management
- **Build vs Runtime**: Separation of build-time and runtime dependencies
- **Package cleanup**: Proper cleanup of package managers and caches
- **Layer optimization**: Better layer caching through strategic COPY ordering

#### .dockerignore Optimization
- **Comprehensive exclusions**: Extensive list of files/directories to exclude
- **Build context reduction**: Significantly reduced build context size
- **Categories covered**:
  - Python artifacts (__pycache__, *.pyc, etc.)
  - Node.js artifacts (node_modules, npm logs, etc.)
  - IDE files (.vscode, .idea, etc.)
  - Documentation files (*.md, README*, etc.)
  - Test files and coverage reports
  - Archived/unused code
  - Certificates and keys
  - CI/CD configurations

### 4. Performance Improvements

#### Build Performance
- **Layer caching**: Optimized COPY order for better cache utilization
- **Parallel builds**: Docker Compose configured for parallel building
- **Dependency caching**: Package files copied before source code

#### Runtime Performance
- **Resource limits**: CPU and memory limits/reservations set
- **Health checks**: Proper health check configurations
- **Restart policies**: Appropriate restart policies for each service

### 5. Resource Management

#### Memory Limits
- **Frontend**: 256M limit, 128M reservation
- **Backend**: 1G limit, 512M reservation  
- **AI Service**: 2G limit, 1G reservation (higher due to AI processing needs)

#### CPU Limits
- **Frontend**: 0.5 CPU limit, 0.25 CPU reservation
- **Backend**: 1.0 CPU limit, 0.5 CPU reservation
- **AI Service**: 1.5 CPU limit, 0.75 CPU reservation

## Before vs After Comparison

### Security Improvements
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| User | Root (uid 0) | Non-root (uid 1001) |
| Privileges | Full privileges | no-new-privileges |
| Capabilities | All capabilities | Minimal capabilities |
| Filesystem | Read-write | Read-only (frontend) |

### Build Efficiency
| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Build stages | Single stage (backend/ai) | Multi-stage |
| Build context | Large (includes all files) | Optimized (.dockerignore) |
| Layer caching | Basic | Optimized |
| Dependencies | Mixed build/runtime | Separated |

### Image Size Reduction
- **Backend**: Reduced by removing build-essential, git from final image
- **AI Service**: Reduced by removing build-essential, libtesseract-dev from final image
- **All services**: Reduced build context through comprehensive .dockerignore

## Testing

A comprehensive test script has been created at `scripts/test_optimized_docker.ps1` that:
- Validates Docker and Docker Compose availability
- Builds all images with optimizations
- Tests container startup and health checks
- Verifies service connectivity
- Monitors resource usage
- Provides detailed feedback on optimizations

## Usage

To test the optimized configurations:

```powershell
# Run the optimization test
.\scripts\test_optimized_docker.ps1

# Or build manually
cd docker
docker-compose build --no-cache
docker-compose up -d
```

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Least Privilege Principle**: Containers run with minimal required privileges
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers (user, capabilities, filesystem)
3. **Resource Constraints**: Proper resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
4. **Build Optimization**: Multi-stage builds and layer caching for efficiency
5. **Monitoring**: Health checks and resource monitoring capabilities

## Future Considerations

1. **Image Scanning**: Consider adding vulnerability scanning to CI/CD pipeline
2. **Secrets Management**: Implement proper secrets management for production
3. **Network Policies**: Consider implementing network policies for additional security
4. **Monitoring**: Add comprehensive monitoring and logging solutions
5. **Backup Strategies**: Implement backup strategies for persistent data
