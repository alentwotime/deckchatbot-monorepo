# Stage 1: Build
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder

# Optional: use custom registry if available
# The build should not fail when `.npmrc` is missing, so we skip copying
# it by default. Uncomment if a registry file is provided.
# COPY .npmrc ./

# Install deps and build
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

### ðŸš€ Stage 2: Serve static files
